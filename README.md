# 👋 Hey, I’m Amit  

I’m a software engineer who loves building clean, reliable, and scalable systems.  
Most of my work lives at the intersection of **TypeScript** and **Python**—from APIs and automation to cloud-native services.  

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- Craft **production-grade APIs** and backend services with a focus on readability and type safety.  
- Build **automation tools** that cut down repetitive work and free up time for the fun stuff.  
- Experiment with **IoT, data pipelines, and cloud architectures** to solve real-world problems.  
- Occasionally tinker with **front-end projects** to keep things balanced.
